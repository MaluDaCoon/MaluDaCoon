When you are freezing/xlaging with someone pull out you're RPG and roll then tap your program and turn it back on and you will have a chance of surving 
depending on the settings/configurations you are using 
Also running away when shooting someone for 5-10secs with a rpg will also help avoid dieing through tap-rips
